When I was little , I thought my country was the best on the planet , and I grew up singing a song called &quot; Nothing To Envy . &quot;
And I was very proud .
In school , we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim Il-Sung , but we never learned much about the outside world , except that America , South Korea , Japan are the enemies .
Although I often wondered about the outside world , I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea , until everything suddenly changed .
When I was seven years old , I saw my first public execution , but I thought my life in North Korea was normal .
My family was not poor , and myself , I had never experienced hunger .
But one day , in 1995 , my mom brought home a letter from a coworker &apos;s sister .
It read , &quot; When you read this , all five family members will not exist in this world , because we haven &apos;t eaten for the past two weeks .
We are lying on the floor together , and our bodies are so weak we are ready to die . &quot;
I was so shocked .
This was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering .
Soon after , when I was walking past a train station , I saw something terrible that I can &apos;t erase from my memory .
A lifeless woman was lying on the ground , while an emaciated child in her arms just stared helplessly at his mother &apos;s face .
But nobody helped them , because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families .
A huge famine hit North Korea in the mid-1990s .
Ultimately , more than a million North Koreans died during the famine , and many only survived by eating grass , bugs and tree bark .
Power outages also became more and more frequent , so everything around me was completely dark at night except for the sea of lights in China , just across the river from my home .
I always wondered why they had lights but we didn &apos;t .
This is a satellite picture showing North Korea at night compared to neighbors .
This is the Amrok River , which serves as a part of the border between North Korea and China .
As you can see , the river can be very narrow at certain points , allowing North Koreans to secretly cross .
But many die .
Sometimes , I saw dead bodies floating down the river .
I can &apos;t reveal many details &#91; about &#93; how I left North Korea , but I only can say that during the ugly years of the famine I was sent to China to live with distant relatives .
But I only thought that I would be separated from my family for a short time .
I could have never imagined that it would take 14 years to live together .
In China , it was hard living as a young girl without my family .
I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee , but I soon learned it &apos;s not only extremely difficult , it &apos;s also very dangerous , since North Korean refugees are considered in China as illegal migrants .
So I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed , and I would be repatriated to a horrible fate back in North Korea .
One day , my worst nightmare came true , when I was caught by the Chinese police and brought to the police station for interrogation .
Someone had accused me of being North Korean , so they tested my Chinese language abilities and asked me tons of questions .
I was so scared , I thought my heart was going to explode .
If anything seemed unnatural , I could be imprisoned and repatriated .
I thought my life was over , but I managed to control all the emotions inside me and answer the questions .
After they finished questioning me , one official said to another , &quot; This was a false report .
She &apos;s not North Korean . &quot;
And they let me go . It was a miracle .
